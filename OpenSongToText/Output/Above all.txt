 Above all powers, above all kings
 Above all nature and all created things
 Above all wisdom, and all the ways of man
 You were there before the world began


 Crucified,
 laid behind the stone
 You lived to die, 
 rejected and alone
  Like a rose, 
 trampled on the ground
 You took the fall
 And thought of me, 
 above all


 Above all kingdoms,
 above all thrones
 Above all wonders
 the world has ever known
 Above all wealth
 and treasures of the earth
 There's no way to measure
 what you're worth
